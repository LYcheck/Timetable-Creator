Gr12 ICS4U Summative - Generates confliction-free master timetable based on wishlists of gr9-gr11 students.

As the culminating task of ICS4U, we were presented with a problem regarding the concept of conflictions and errors within the class-scheduling algorithm in our own school. Was it possible to create a more efficient scheduling system than the one currently in place, with our level of programming expertise? In the end; yes! Given a CSV file containing sample student names, ID numbers, grades, and courses on their wishlist, we were able to generate a master timetable free of any scheduling errors and mismatched courses. The algorithm we implemented cut down the time it took to create such a list by 75% - (as per our vice principal).

As I refocus on this project, I plan to port the code to a C++ format while optimizing any parts of the code that I can. These optimizations may include algorithm changes, method redesigns, and overall structure.
